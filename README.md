# PASSWORD GENERATOR TELEGRAM BOT

This bot will help you generate some **random, strong** *passwords* and *passphrases* as your requested length.

This mini-project was started by me as a fun project but it gained over [250+](https://t.me/BotsArchive/1786 "BotsArchive post link") users and [3.8 / 5](https://t.me/BotsArchive/1786 "BotsArchive post link") score in [BotsArchive channel](https://t.me/BotsArchive "BotsArchive channel"). So I am continuing to improve it furthur.
Please ping me in telegram [@BeastImran](https://t.me/BeastImran) if you want to use this code or files in your project in anyway or need to query something or you want to involve in this project in any manner.

## How to use this bot in telegram

**Start a chat with this [bot](https://t.me/SimpleStrongPasswordGeneratorBot "bot telegram link")**

  `/start` : to see the welcome message.
  
  `/gen` : to generate a 32 chatacter length password.
  
  `/gen num` : to generate a num character length password.
  
  **example:**

  `/gen 8` `/gen 10` `/gen 16` `/gen 64`

  ðŸ”‘ passwords generated using /gen command are very strong ðŸ’ª but are not easy to remember. You should have some amount of guts to remember such passwords.
  It's better if you use a pass phrase if you want to remember. A pass phrase is a kind of password which is a combination of several `n` different words like as shown bellow.
  
  pass-phrase: absentee afternoon plus repackage long
  
  `/phrase` : to generate 8 words length pass-phrase

  `/phrase num` : to generate a pass phrase with num words
  
  **example:**
  
  `/phrase 4` `/phrase 8` `/phrase 12` `/phrase 20`
  
  **SMALL FEATURES:**

  `/save`: to save any notes or passwords

  note: all the saved notes are [encrypted](https://github.com/BeastImran/password-generator-bot/blob/main/encryption.md) and no one without a valid decryption key can read the notes. keys are unique to each user. read more about it on my [github page](https://github.com/BeastImran). try `/dev`

  example:

  `/save` I need to meet a friend @12:30 pm today!

  `/save` My amazon pass is AmAsOnPaSz
<br><br><br>
  `/get`: to retrive or get all saved notes

  **OTHER COMMANDS:**
  
  `/stat`: to see your statistics
  
  `/gstat`: to see global statistics
  
  `/dev`: to see info about this bot's developer
